ScoreKeeper is a simple JS app that keeps the score between two ping pong players. I am building this as a learning experience in my web development journey.

The app is fully responsive and does not use any frameworks. It uses 3 files only:

1. scoreKeeperVH.html
2. scoreKeeperVH.js
3. scoreKeeperVH.css

I would like to implement the following features in the future:

1. Winning score count increase when players are tied at the penultimate point.
2. Options for players to enter their respective names.
3. Offer a save state, so that players can keep track of scores even after closing/exiting the app.
4. Offer a tournament feature for more than 2 players.
